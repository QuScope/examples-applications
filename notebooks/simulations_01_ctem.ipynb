    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to simulate Bright Field Conventional Transmission Electron Microscopy (BF-CTEM). We replicate the results of Kirkland (2010) to validate our quantum-enhanced method. Here, we will start with a weak phase object (WPO) approximation for five elements, and transition to the multislice algorithm for GaAs.\n",
