# QuScope Example Applications

**Welcome to the official example and tutorials repository for [QuScope](https://github.com/QuScope/QuScope)** - a quantum-enhanced electron microscopy analysis framework.

This repository contains interactive notebooks, reproducible demos, and educational materials designed to showcase how to use QuScope for a range of quantum-enhanced tasks, including:

Image Analysis:
- Encoding, Decoding, Filters & Denoising

EELS Analysis:
- Quantum Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution (QRLD)
- Quantum Kramers-Kronig Transformation (QKKT)
- Low-Loss Analysis
- Core-Loss Analysis

Electron Diffraction:
- Phase Analysis
- Space Group Analysis
- Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED)

Simulations:
- Quantum-Enhanced Weak Phase Object Approximation
- Quantum-Enhanced Multislice Algorithm

General:
- Quantum encoding and transformations
